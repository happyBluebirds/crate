Release Notes
=============

Before upgrading a cluster you should `back up your data`_.

If you are upgrading from one release line to another (i.e. from 1.1 to 1.2) you must do a full cluster restart. If you are upgrading within release line (i.e. from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1) you can do a :ref:`cluster_upgrade`.
